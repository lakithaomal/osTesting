# Terraform

## Terraform Commands

Terraform uses a simple workflow: **initialize → plan → apply → destroy**.  
These commands form the core lifecycle of managing infrastructure as code (IaC).

---

### `terraform init`
Initializes a Terraform working directory.

This command:
- Downloads and installs the required providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
- Sets up the `.terraform` directory
- Prepares the backend (if configured)

You must run this **once**, before any plan or apply.

Example:
```
terraform init
```

---

### `terraform plan`
Creates an execution plan showing what actions Terraform will take.

This command:
- Compares your `.tf` configuration with the real infrastructure
- Shows additions, updates, and deletions
- Does **not** make changes—only displays them

Example:
```
terraform plan
```

Use this to verify the changes before applying.

---

### `terraform apply`
Applies the changes required to reach the desired state.

This command:
- Executes the actions shown in the plan
- Creates, updates, or deletes resources on the provider
- Prompts for approval unless `-auto-approve` is used

Example:
```
terraform apply
```

---


### `terraform destroy`
Destroys all resources managed by Terraform in the current workspace.

This command:
- Reads the state file
- Determines what Terraform created
- Removes everything safely and in order

Use this for cleanup in sandbox/test environments.

Example:
```
terraform destroy
```
